### bubble sort algorithm

Inspired by an article on bubble sorting here: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation

It's my first Rust code using generic types, it works with arrays of numbers, characters and strings.

I added it as the Rust section: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Sorting/Bubble_sort#Rust
